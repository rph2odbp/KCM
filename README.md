# KCM (Kateri Camp Management)

End-to-end camp management platform: registration, rosters, Adyen payments, medical administration records (MAR), photo galleries, reports, and AI tools—built with React + Firebase and CI/CD from GitHub.

## 🎯 Clean-Slate Build Plan

This repository provides a complete, production-ready foundation for modern camp management with:

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Yarn workspaces with `web`, `functions`, and `shared` packages
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React + Vite + TypeScript (web) and Firebase Cloud Functions (Node 20, TS)
- **Type Safety**: Shared types with Zod validation across frontend and backend
- **Firebase Integration**: Firestore database, Authentication, Cloud Functions, and Storage
- **Payment Processing**: Adyen integration for secure payment handling
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment workflows
- **Development Environment**: Codespaces with pre-configured emulators

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Yarn package manager
- Firebase CLI
- Firebase project (create at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com))

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/rph2odbp/KCM.git
cd KCM/kateri-monorepo
yarn install

# Configure Firebase
cp .firebaserc.example .firebaserc
# Edit .firebaserc with your Firebase project ID

# Start development servers
yarn start:emulators  # Firebase emulators
yarn workspace:web dev  # React app (http://localhost:5173)
yarn workspace:functions serve  # Functions emulator
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy environment files:

   ```bash
   cp kateri-monorepo/packages/web/.env.example kateri-monorepo/packages/web/.env.local
   cp kateri-monorepo/packages/functions/.env.local.example kateri-monorepo/packages/functions/.env.local
   ```

2. Configure Firebase settings in `.env.local` files
3. Set up Adyen test credentials for payment integration

## 🧭 Operations & Phase 0 Foundations

This project is set up with production-minded operations from day one. Key pieces you’ll use most often are summarized here for quick reference.

### Functions Gen 2 and Firestore

- Runtime: Firebase Functions Gen 2 (Node 22), region `us-central1`.
- Named Firestore DB: `kcm-db` (not the default). All triggers and Admin calls use this DB explicitly.

### Backups (Firestore export)

- Daily export function: `backupFirestoreDaily` at 03:00 America/New_York.
- Target bucket: `gs://kcm-firebase-b7d6a-backups` with a 60‑day lifecycle on `firestore-exports/*`.
- Service account: `kcm-backup@kcm-firebase-b7d6a.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (least privilege: Firestore import/export + Storage object admin on the backups bucket).
- Config for functions-gen2 is stored in `.env` at: `kateri-monorepo/packages/functions-gen2/.env.kcm-firebase-b7d6a` with:
  - `FIRESTORE_BACKUP_BUCKET=kcm-firebase-b7d6a-backups`
  - `FIRESTORE_BACKUP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=kcm-backup@kcm-firebase-b7d6a.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### Alerts

- Failure alert (log match): fires on `Export failed` from service `backupfirestoredaily` (rate‑limited to 1/hr).
- Missed run alert (absence): fires if `backupfirestoredaily` receives no HTTP requests for ~23h (Cloud Run `request_count`).
- Email channel: verified `ryanhallford.br@gmail.com`.
- Helper script to (re)attach channel to backup alerts: `scripts/attach_backup_alerts.sh`.

### Restore drill (validate backups)

- Script: `scripts/restore_drill.sh`.
- What it does: finds the latest export in `gs://kcm-firebase-b7d6a-backups/firestore-exports/kcm-db/<timestamp>/`, creates a temporary DB `kcm-restore`, runs an import via the Firestore Admin API, polls until complete, and exits when done.
- Cleanup: the script doesn’t delete the DB; delete protection is enabled on create. To remove later, disable delete protection and delete the DB (see Ops runbook or use the commands shown in prior sessions).

### Phase 0 checklist (foundations)

- [x] Gen 2 migration with named Firestore DB
- [x] Backups: daily export to dedicated bucket with lifecycle and least‑privileged SA
- [x] Alerts: failure + missed run, email channel verified
- [x] Restore drill: automated script and successful dry‑run
- [x] CI/CD deploys via GitHub Actions with OIDC
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard: surface request_count, error logs, and backup signals
- [ ] Monthly restore drill reminder (calendar/task)
- [ ] Error tracking/analytics wiring in the web app (as needed)

Dashboard quick link (Monitoring):

## 🧩 UX blueprint (GCP Console–inspired)

- Global context switcher: Season/session selector (like GCP project selector).
- Persistent left nav: Dashboard, Camps, Campers, Registrations, Payments, Communications, Reports, Settings.
- Resource list → detail with tabs: Overview, Details, People, Documents, Activity, Permissions.
- Utility bar: search, date/session filter, export, create.
- Role‑based visibility: only show actions the user can perform.
- Material UI recommended for fast, accessible ergonomics.

## 🗺 Phased delivery plan (rough effort)

Assumes Firebase/Firestore + React stack, solo/small team. Ranges reflect unknowns.

- Phase 0 — Foundations & ops (1–2 weeks) [partially done]
  - CI/CD, environments, feature flags, error tracking, analytics
  - SLOs, dashboards, alerts, runbooks
- Phase 1 — Auth, RBAC, and app shell (2–3 weeks)
- Phase 2 — Data model and core entities (3–4 weeks)
- Phase 3 — Payments and billing (3–5 weeks)
- Phase 4 — Forms and compliance (2–4 weeks)
- Phase 5 — Check‑in/out and operations (2–4 weeks)
- Phase 6 — Communications (2–3 weeks)
- Phase 7 — Reporting and exports (2–3 weeks)
- Phase 8 — Quality, polish, accessibility (2–4 weeks)
- Phase 9 — Hardening and scale (1–2 weeks)

Estimated new work remaining for a “complete” system: ~75–85% (MVP‑plus ~4–7 months depending on scope and parallelism).
